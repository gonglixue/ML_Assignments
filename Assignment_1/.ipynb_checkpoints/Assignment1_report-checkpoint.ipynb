    "* False. Firstly, somethimes there are some wrong samples in data set which will cause problems for training model. So not all the data should be used when training. And secondly, if we maximize performance on the whole dataset, it will cause over-fitting problem, which is not beneficial for training a general model.\n",

    "False. Usually, the number of ham emails is much larger than spam emails. For example, if the ratio of spam and ham email is 1:99, we probably can not filter any spam email by a model with 99% accuracy.

    "In my opinion, for a spam filter, precision is more important. It is not a matter if a user receive only a few of spam emails. While users don't want their important emails are lost. It is not a good strategy for a spam filter to regard as too many emails as spam. So the precision is more important.\n",
    "However, when we identify drugs and bombs, the risk of omission is much higher. Consequently we always expect that drugs or bombs can be recognized as much as possible. We would rather classify something safe as drugs than miss a dangerous bombs. So recall is more important in this situation.\n"
